== Description ==

The Gravity Forms Save Between Pages Add-On is to be used with the [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/ "Gravity Forms Plugin") plugin by Rocketgenius.
The add-on is designed for multi-page forms and saves users' form input as they are move between pages. The add on will capture their inputs even if they don't submit the form.
User entries are only progressivly saved on forms that have the Save Between Pages setting enabled.
The add-on can be used on public facing forms and doesn't requre user login.
